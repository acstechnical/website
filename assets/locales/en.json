  "explain_DDoS_title1": "What is a DDoS Attack?",
  "explain_DDoS_content1": "A DDoS attack, or distributed denial-of-service attack, is a type of cybercrime involving the flooding of a target with internet traffic to make it unavailable. DDoS attacks are a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack, but they are much more powerful than traditional DoS attacks because they use multiple sources to generate exponentially larger traffic volumes.",
  "explain_DDoS_title2": "How Can Acronics Solutions Help Protect Your Infrastructure?",
  "explain_DDoS_content2": "The goal of a DDoS attack is to overwhelm system resources or bandwidth, making legitimate traffic difficult or impossible to reach its destination. DDoS attacks can",

  "explain_IPSec_content3": "Protects traffic by sending packets directly between two servers that have established an IPsec tunnel. That is, when the endpoints communicate and cryptography is the same. The IP packet payload is encrypted, but the IP header is not.",
  "explain_IPSec_content4": "Tunnel mode encapsulates the original IP packet into another packet in the VPN tunnel to protect traffic. This method authenticates peers using a pre-shared key with IKE or digital certificates with IKE.",
